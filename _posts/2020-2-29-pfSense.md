### pfSense as home router

#### Why
- Netgear R7900P started hanging daily, albeit loved it WiFi coverage
- Popular open router platform
- used with Protectly appliance

#### Environment:
- Comcast + own Arris SBG6580
- Unify AP pro for WiFi (PoE powered), requires Unify Controller to manage

#### Documentation:
- https://nguvu.org/
- https://protectli.com/kb/how-to-install-esxi-on-the-vault - just an idea 
- https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/index.html 

#### Challenges:
- NAT behind NAT - switch modem to bridge mode
- Strange DHCP6 behavior resulting in continuous networking restarts, which slows down things. Used static configuration.
- upgrade to RC version did not go well, had to run update manually from ssh session
- quite sensitive to power loss - parts of config wiped after accidental power cut.

#### Impressions:
- solution for enthusiasts
- nice way to learn basic networking in-and-out
