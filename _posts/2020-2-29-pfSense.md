### pfSense as home router

#### Why
- Netgear R7900P started hanging daily, albeit loved its WiFi coverage
- Popular open router platform
- Used with Protectly appliance

#### Environment:
- Comcast + own Arris SBG6580
- Unify AP Pro for WiFi (PoE powered), requires Unify Controller to manage

#### Documentation:
- [Netgate pfSense](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/index.html)
- [Collection of pfSence Solutions](https://nguvu.org/)
- [pfSense on ESXi](https://protectli.com/kb/how-to-install-esxi-on-the-vault) - just an idea 
- [OpenVPN + Google authenticator](https://vorkbaard.nl/how-to-set-up-openvpn-with-google-authenticator-on-pfsense/)

#### Challenges/Observations:
- NAT behind NAT solutions
  - switch DOCSYS modem to bridge mode
  - disable blocking private networks and reserved addresses, since pfSense is behind firewall
- Strange DHCP6 behavior resulting in continuous networking restarts, which slows down things. Static IP configuration fixed this.
- upgrade from stable to RC version did not go well, had to run update manually from ssh session. RC receives fresh packages, including kernel, neat.
- quite sensitive to power loss - parts of config wiped after accidental power cut.
- used dns-forwarder, instead of resolver. Resolver traverses DNS from root servers (can work in forward mode). Forwarder (dnsmasq) simply passes requests to configured servers.

#### Impressions:
- solution for enthusiasts, although pretty solid
- nice way to learn/refresh basic networking in-and-out
