### pfSense as home router

#### Why
- Netgear R7900P started hanging daily, albeit loved it WiFi coverage
- Popular open router platform
- used with Protectly appliance

#### Environment:
- Comcast + own Arris SBG6580
- Unify AP pro for WiFi (PoE powered), requires Unify Controller to manage

#### Documentation:
- https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/index.html 
- https://nguvu.org/
- https://protectli.com/kb/how-to-install-esxi-on-the-vault - just an idea 
- https://vorkbaard.nl/how-to-set-up-openvpn-with-google-authenticator-on-pfsense/

#### Challenges/Observations:
- NAT behind NAT - switch modem to bridge mode, or disable blocking private networks, and reserved addresses, since pfSense is behind firewall.
- Strange DHCP6 behavior resulting in continuous networking restarts, which slows down things. Static configuration fixed this.
- upgrade to RC version did not go well, had to run update manually from ssh session.
- quite sensitive to power loss - parts of config wiped after accidental power cut.
- use dns-forwarder, instead of resolver. Resolver traverses DNS from root servers (can work in forward mode). Forwarder (dnsmasq) simply passes requests to configured servers.

#### Impressions:
- solution for enthusiasts, although pretty solid
- nice way to learn/refresh basic networking in-and-out
